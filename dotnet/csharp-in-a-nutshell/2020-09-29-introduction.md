This is the first in a series of posts, where I will collect notes and thoughts from reading [C# 8.0 in a Nutshell: The Definitive Reference 1st Edition](https://www.amazon.com/C-8-0-Nutshell-Definitive-Reference/dp/1492051136).
This is my attempt at getting more familiar with the language that I use daily thrughout my work.

My first experience with C# was during my Bachelor of Software Development in 2015, where we had to work with message queues - and C# was the language being thought at that school. I was more familiar with Java, as that was what I used during my Academy Profession in Computer Science. At work I used Ruby on Rails, so C# was new to me at the time.

My first full-time job after the bachelor was primarily in C# and some HTML/Jade (now known as Pug), CSS and JS. I remember that I bought the [C# 6.0 in a Nutshell: The Definitive Reference 6th Edition](https://www.amazon.com/C-6-0-Nutshell-Definitive-Reference/dp/1491927062) right after I started the job, so that I could use it as an reference. I did, and it served me well, but now I want to read the newest addition from start to finish, collecting notes that I deem important to me.

I'm thinking of making a seperate blog post per chapter in the book, so that my notes are collected according to the book.

* Chapter 1: Introducing C# and .NET Core
* Chapter 2: Language Basics
* Chapter 3: Creating Types in C#
* Chapter 4: Advanced C#
